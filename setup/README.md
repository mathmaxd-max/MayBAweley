## Important notes

- Some marketing claims (e.g., bestseller placements) appear in bios on retailer/publisher pages. Treat them as claims unless you can independently verify.
- For Amazon user reviews, be careful: author permission may not cover reviewer rights/platform terms. See `content/social_proof_policy.md`.


## Added in v2
- `data/social_proof.json` – platform rating snapshots + usage notes
- `content/social_proof_inventory.md` – quick guidance and badge examples
