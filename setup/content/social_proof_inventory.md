# Social proof inventory (safe-first)

As of **2026-01-22**, this folder contains:
- **Facts-based recognition** (Skoutz-Award items, juror role) and **feature/interview links**
- **Time-stamped rating snapshots** from LovelyBooks (stars, count, breakdown)

## What is included (and why)

### 1) Recognition and roles (generally safe to state as facts)
See: `data/recognition.json`.

### 2) Platform rating snapshots (use with caution; link-first)
See: `data/social_proof.json` → `platform_metrics.lovelybooks`.

Recommended presentation:
- Display as *a time-stamped snapshot* and link back to the platform page.
- Consider only showing ratings for titles that cross thresholds (e.g., >= 4.0 stars and >= 10 ratings).

### 3) Quotes and review text
This bundle **does not** include verbatim third-party review text. Even when publicly visible, it is typically copyrighted and/or controlled by platform terms.

If you want to use quotes:
- Prefer **cover blurbs** you already have rights to (ask the author to provide the exact text + attribution).
- For blog/press quotes, obtain **written permission** from the rights holder and keep it on file.
