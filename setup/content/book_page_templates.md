# Book page copy templates (non-spoiler)

Use these to keep each book page consistent and conversion-friendly.

## Per-book fields

- Hook line (1 sentence): emotional pull, no plot twist.
- Teaser (80–120 words): premise, stakes, atmosphere.
- What to expect (3 bullets): themes, pacing, tone.
- Trigger notes (optional): only if the author wants.
- CTA: Amazon button + optional secondary CTA (series order).

## Example pattern

### Hook
> A single decision turns certainty into suspicion.

### Teaser
Keep this focused on setup + stakes. No killer identity, no final-act revelations.

### What to expect
- Psychological suspense, NYC setting
- Investigator perspective with strong character focus
- Minimal gore; maximum tension
