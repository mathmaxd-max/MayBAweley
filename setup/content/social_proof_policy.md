# Social proof: what you can safely use (and what to avoid)

You mentioned: cover quotes, Amazon/social proof statements, reviews, and excerpts.

## 1) Cover blurbs / “Press quotes” on the book cover
Usually safe if you have rights (either the quote owner granted rights, or the blurb is already licensed for use on the cover).
- Best practice: keep the quote short, attribute clearly (name/outlet), and do not alter wording.

## 2) Reader reviews from Amazon (the risky one)
Even with the author’s permission, copying and displaying Amazon user reviews verbatim can be problematic:
- Review text is created by the reviewer and displayed under Amazon’s terms.
- Republishing reviews can raise both copyright and platform policy issues.

Safer alternatives:
- Link to the Amazon review section for each book.
- Display aggregates you can substantiate (e.g., “4.6/5 based on 1,234 ratings”) only if you can reliably source the number (and keep it current).
- If you want to show verbatim reviews on the site: get explicit permission from the reviewer(s) and store consent.

## 3) Excerpts / first pages
If you have explicit permission from the author (and any publisher, if applicable), excerpts are typically fine.
Best practice:
- Limit to a short excerpt and add “Spoiler-free” labeling.
- Avoid showing major reveals or the full opening chapter unless the author wants that.

## 4) Testimonials from bloggers / press
If you quote a blogger or press outlet:
- Use a short excerpt, attribute properly, and link to the original.
- Consider asking for permission if the quote is substantial.


## 3) Ratings & reviews from LovelyBooks (similar caveats)
LovelyBooks ratings/reviews are also third-party content. A safer pattern is:
- Link to the LovelyBooks page for each title.
- If you display **star averages and rating counts**, present them as a **time-stamped snapshot** and avoid copying any individual review text.
- If you want to display excerpts from reader opinions, obtain explicit permission from the reviewer.
