# Social proof candidates (permission-dependent)

This file lists high-value social proof items that exist online but should only be used on the author's website with explicit permission from the rights holder.

See: `data/social_proof_candidates.json`

General workflow:
1. Contact the outlet/reviewer.
2. Ask for written permission to reuse the exact quote (text + attribution) on the author's website and marketing materials.
3. Store the permission proof (email/PDF) with date and scope.
4. Use the quote verbatim (no paraphrasing), keep it short, and link back to the source where appropriate.
